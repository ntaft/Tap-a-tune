# Tap-a-tune

User Story:

If you ever find yourself tapping your fingers to an imaginary beat? This is the chance to turn that music into reality. Using a  glove with conductive fingertips, tap on any conductive surface (such as a metal table, your arm, even a houseplant) and using a makey-makey as an interface, record that beat using a portable Rasberry Pi running an express server. Automatically upload your musical creation to the cloud,  and save it on your personal Tap-a-Tune web page. Alter the sounds produced using a musical interface drawn from the MIDI api [and potentially share with friends or download a compatible MIDI file - if I have time].
